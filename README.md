- How do you use the getresourcestream method to get the config files if you move all the classes into packages?



#To Do XML Parser

- **2 XML files????**
- **Change the Simulation.properties and XML so that rules dont have specific names**
- **Is what I am doing with the properties file cheating in a way?**
  + For Example the Cell.properties file

- Separate the Cell parsing from the Factory** + **Extend the Cell parsing to create the different cells
  + default values
  + probability distribution for cells
  + Default cell location?

#Sim Refactoring

- Remove hardcoded state ints
